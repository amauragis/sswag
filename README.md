# sswag
Simple Static Website And Gallery.  It's hip, it's swag.  It's *sswag*.

### What is it
Take some markdown files, and optionally some organized images, and generate a static
bootstrap website that is "responsive", has a pretty nav bar, and looks better than
other things that I have made.

### \~~Origin Story\~~
At some point in the past, I stole a static website generator from
[Branden Ghena](https://github.com/brghena/brghena-homepage) who had previously
stolen the same code from [Pat Pannuto](https://github.com/ppannuto/patpannuto.com).
I used this code to generate my [homepage](https://github.com/amauragis/homepage) and
decided that I wanted to add an image gallery to one of the pages, as sometimes I take
photographs.  I started with [sigal](https://github.com/saimn/sigal/) which is really
good but I wanted to make it fit into the template that I was already using, and
instead of figuring out how to make it do what I wanted I decided to shamelessly copy
the parts that did what I wanted.  And well, here we are.

## Installation
You can't install something that doesn't exist yet, sorry.

## Usage
Well you just do whatever it is that you're supposed to do.
